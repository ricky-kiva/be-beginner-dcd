I follow the Moskva down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
An August summer night, soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change

The world is closing in
And did you ever think
That we could be so close like brothers?
The future's in the air, I can feel it everywhere
I'm blowing with the wind of change
